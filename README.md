# lightcc_soscs_rpg_cs_tutorial

Repository development from going through the "Build a C#/WPF RPG" at https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/

All tutorial lessons with code from the tutorial without additions or improvements are in the master branch.
Additional branches may have been created for each Chapter, then merged back to master and tagged at the end of each
lesson (for example, tag 06.2.0 is added after "Chapter" 6 is concluded with Lesson 06.2).

There is an msl-refactoring branch which has refactors for various things I wanted to modify personally, which then has 
master merged back into it regularly to keep up with the tutorial.  This has the added "advantage" of having regular merge
conflicts and therefore is training me how to resolve conflicts, fix commits and commit messages for merging and
conflict resolution, etc.  I know this is an activity that happens regularly in real-world projects and it's great
to learn this Git (and SCM in general) skill.
